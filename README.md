# Numonic

A tool for memorizing numbers. Translates any number (or a sequence of numbers)
into a list of matching words (according to letter to number mapping). When
used with `-d` flag, translates a word (or a sequence of words) into a number
using the same mapping. At the moment, letter to number mapping excludes vowels,
letter 'y' and letters with diacritics.
